                        <p> Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to work with notable clients such as Comcast and CapitalOne, gaining exposure to a diverse set of tools and technologies. My expertise includes proficiency in Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Concourse, Drone, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Datadog, ELK, NewRelic, and APM Traces using the Jaeger tool. I've implemented robust DevSecOps pipelines utilizing Whitesource and Checkmarx, incorporating code quality scans with SonarQube. Additionally, my responsibilities extended to addressing server and container security vulnerabilities through tools like Qualys, CrowdStrike, Eracent, and others. Proficient in source code management using Git and Artifactory by JFrog, I've effectively utilized cloud resources such as EC2, Lambda, IAM, S3, ECS-EC2, ECS-Fargate, Elastic Cache, DocumentDB, RDS, VPC, and more, provisioning them both in AWS and OpenStack. My comprehensive skill set underscores my commitment to excellence in navigating the complexities of DevOps engineering.
